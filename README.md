A simple script to save the latest ACfA regulation.
Place it in the same directory as rpcs3.exe. If you are using Inveigh's 4thgenPack, you can also place it in the parent directory.

Supports BLJM60066/BLJM55005/BLUS30187. If you want to avoid updating a specific region, please remove the directory for that region from "rconfig.txt".

If you only want to perform an update, run 'RegUpdateChecker.bat'. If you want to run it simultaneously with launching RPCS3, run 'GameLauncher.bat'.
